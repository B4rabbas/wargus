Wargus is data game set for Stratagus engine. This is only launcher and wrapper
for Stratagus, and shares most of its commandline arguments.

Wargus has specific command line arguments to start multiplayer games:
.TP
.B -c multiplayer -G server,numplayers=(number),map=(path-to-map)[,dedicated,race=(orc|human),player=(nick),fow=(1|0),revealmap=(0|1)]
These arguments start a multiplayer server. It will directly select the passed
map and wait for numplayers players to join and become ready (including the
server), before automatically starting the game. The numplayers and map
arguments are required, the race, player nickname, fow (fog of war), and
revealmap options are optional. Note that if there are spaces or other
characters that must be escaped in the nickname or map path, you must escape
them (or enclose the entire argument in quotes). If the dedicated option is
passed, the server will itself only be an AI player, and wait for numplayers
clients to connect (excluding the server).
